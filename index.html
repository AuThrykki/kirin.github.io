			<h3>
				Welcome!
			</h3>
			<p>
				You're most likely reading this, because you've decided to take care of kirin! Thank you very much for
				that! :)
			</p>

			<p>
				Be aware that shibas are strange dogs. They originate from Japan and are classified as "ancient"
				dogs ("urhund"). They're not as social as most european dogs, don't look for eye contact as much, or
				read clues, and they don't work together as nicely with humans. They're very independent and a bit
				cat-like at times.
			</p>
			<p>
				This webpage is meant as as care instructions for kirin, I hope you'll find this useful. <br>
				- Anthony
			</p>
			<h3>
				Routine:
			</h3>
			We usually go for 3(-4) walks. A typical day looks something like this:
			<ul>
				<li>
					6:00-10:00 - He wakes up on his own and wakes us up, or if it's before 7:30 we wake him up (for work
					etc.)
				</li>
				<li>
					6:30-10:00 - Short walk 15-20 minutes for pee/poop. He goes back to sleep then.
				</li>
				<li>
					+-11:00 - Kirin gets fed 3 meatballs of vom.
				</li>
				<li>
					13:00-15:00 Another walk for 30-60 minutes afterward, less if you play, more if you just walk. Then
					chill/play at home.
				</li>
				<li>+-18:00 - Kirin gets fed another 3 meatballs of vom.</li>
				<li>
					18-22: another last walk between 5-30 minutes, depending on how much energy he has.
				</li>
			</ul>
			Kirin is generally flexible and never pees indoors; he can also manage 10 hours here and there. Ideally, I
			would take him out after a maximum of 6-7 hours, but he can hold it longer at night.

			<h3>
				Food:
			</h3>
			<p>

				Kirin gets a mixture of dry food (kibble) and wet food (vom meatballs). In general he always has kibble
				and water available. The meatballs he gets twice a day at 11 and 18. He cannot eat then frozen, so you
				will need
				to thaw the meatballs, for example by always having 3-6 in the fridge (4C) instead of in the freezer. We
				always make sure to have the next set of meatballs defrosted and ready in the fridge. </br>
				Otherwise kirin doesn't eat much until later in the evening, where he usually suddenly eats a lot of
				kibble.
			</p>
			<p>

				Besides, he loves to get some liver pâté (leverpåstei) now and then, preferably in a frozen Kong (one of
				those red toys that can be filled up and frozen). It also helps calm him down when he's nervous. </br>
				He hardly gets any/hardly any human food, and it can upset his stomach a bit. But you can give him
				dog-treats whenever you feel like it. Of course it's more fun if he needs to work for it, by doing
				tricks etc.
			</p>
			<h3>Being Outside:</h3>
			Kirin loves being outside. It's a lot more interesting than being inside, since he's allowed to smell, pee,
			mess around with things, and he loves that "stuff is happening". Kirin loves people walking by, sounds,
			noises, maybe even other dogs. Take him out whenever you want to - and when he doesn't need to rest. He will
			be thankful, and more tired at home.
			<h3>Being Outside - leash behaviour</h3>
			Kirin is a shiba and will most likely not listen or come back, if you ever let him off the leash - so
			please, never leave kirin off the leash. He's used to walking on a long leash of 4-5 meters, and prefer to
			walk "further away" from the person who walks him. He also crosses the street without checking for cars.
			Don't be afraid to just stop him from walking with the leash physially - In general when he does anything
			stupid, just use force to drag him away.
			<h3>
				Greeting and Interaction with Others:
			</h3>
			It's best to avoid greeting other dogs if possible. Kirin is very eager, but he can suddenly become
			aggressive and needs to be interrupted. While we owners can manage him, I think its easier for dog sitters
			to just fully avoid it. People and children can greet if they want, but make them aware that Kirin jumps,
			nips, and may tug at clothes - he gets very excited. <br>

			<h3>Play:</h3>
			<p>
				Kirin plays a bit rough sometimes. He's very mouthy and uses his teeth. He's allowed to carefully mouth on fingers and wrists, as long as you are comfortable, and he never bites hard. Feel free to tell him off if he ever tries to bite you - you should just get angry with him and say "SLUTT" or something similar - he will get it if you seem angry enough. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He loves tugging, so you can use a rope toy, and hold it, while he tries to drag it away. Kirin also loves hunting toys, if you move them quickly. He has hunting instincts and will try to hunt down quickly moving things.
			</p>				
			<h3>
				Commands:
			</h3>
			He responds more to "vibes" and the situation rather than words, but below are the words we use. Kirin does
			rarely actually listen to commands, but rather "thinks about them" - unless you have some really good food
			for him.
			<ul>
				<li>
					"Kom" - if kirin stops, I will say this to indicate that I'm walking.
				</li>
				<li>
					"Kom her" - come to me - frankly this rarely works, but you can comebine this will dragging him on
					the leash
				</li>
				<li>
					"Sitt" (with a pointing finger in the air) - sitt down
				</li>
				<li>
					"Platz / plats" (often with a flat hand on the ground) - lie down (he usually gets some treat if he complies)
				</li>
				<li>
					"Legge seg" - lie completely down with head down
				</li>
				<li>
					"Ferdig" (both palms flat and open toward him) - "playtime is over, let us be, stop"
				</li>
				<li>
					"Slutt!" - "interrupt, stop it" works only when you're angry/strict enough
				</li>
				<li>
					"Aus!" - "drop what's in your mouth", say this strictly
				</li>
				<li>
					"Nei! / uh-uh" - to indicate he shouldn't do something he's showing interest in
				</li>
				<li>
					"Boop" (and hold a fist in front of the face) - for him to nudge his snout against the fist
				</li>
				<li>
					"Touch" (with an open hand) - for him to touch/bite the hand
				</li>
				<li>
					"Bli" - so he remains sitting somewhere, while you go away/hide something etc. This only works when he expects something in return.
				</li>
				<li>
					"Over" - to let him know we're crossing a road, he manages fine without, but I usually tell him
				</li>
				<li>
					"Snu" - to get him to turn around, take a turn, if he walks the wrong way. Not magic, but just an additional indication to pull the leash a bit.
				</li>
			</ul>
